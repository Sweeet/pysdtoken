# pysdtoken
A pythonic (?) ctypes wrapper for RSA SecurID Tokens
I am somewhat new to Python and barely intermediate in C-style languages, so this was my attempt to fill a gap that I saw. I could not find a way to access the Soft Token using python, but lots of VPN vendors use the vendor SDK to do what I wanted to do.
